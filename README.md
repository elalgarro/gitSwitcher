### To try out the project

- clone this repo
- run `make thebuild`
- this will create a build directory and a binary file named `gitSwitcher`

Then, you can add an alias to this binary file in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

```bash
alias gitme="path/to/gitSwitcher"
```

Once this is added, navigate to a git repository and try it out

```
gitme
```
